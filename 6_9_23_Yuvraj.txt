* Triggers
	Triggers in Azure Data Factory are processing units that determine when to start or stop a pipeline execution
	- Schedule Trigger is used to invoke pipeline at a specific time. We can specify the start and end date, the time zone, the frequency, and the interval of the trigger
	- Tumbling window trigger is a trigger that executes a pipeline on a periodic interval, while also retaining the state of the previous executions. We can specify the size, frequency, offset, and delay of the tumbling window
	- Event based triggers run a pipeline in response to a foreign event. Storage event trigger run a pipeline in response to an event in storage account
